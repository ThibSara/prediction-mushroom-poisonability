Projet Bonus Machine Learning : 24 d√©cembre 2023

you choose a problem related to a major, you pose the problem related to the ML, you formalize your problem and you provide the solution(s) by choosing two algorithms to answer it. The expectations for each group are as follows:

1- a document which can be a PowerPoint presentation, or a pdf document, or a tutorial using the notebook. Any way, you have to Include your notebook to your work(your code will be examined)

2-This document must contain the following sections: presentation of the topic and contextualization, description of the problem, formalization of the problem, solutions and arguments for the choice of algorithms, experimentation and discussion of the results; group assessment (what you have learned, points for improvement).

3-Don't forget to include a cover page with the title of your contribution, the composition of the group and the name of the major to which you belong.

4- Add all the necessary references: code, data, algorithms, etc.

The deadline for submitting this work is 12/24. formalization of the problem, solutions and arguments for the choice of algorithms, experimentation and discussion of the results; group report (this is the first part of the document).
